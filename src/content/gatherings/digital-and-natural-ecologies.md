This special gathering collects reflections of the Critical Code Studies Working Group 2020 (CCSWG ‘20), a biannual meeting to explore the intersections of humanistic inquiry and computer code studies. Coordinated by Mark Marino (USC), Jeremy Douglass (UCSB), and Zach Mann (USC), the 2020 Working Group was held online from January 20 to February 3. It brought together more than 150 participants from around the world to share ideas, populating dozens of discussion threads with hundreds of comments, critiques, and critical readings.

The need to attend to code could not be more urgent. Code exerts a regulatory effect over society and culture: it can influence how we interpret the world and even structure the ways we move through it. Over the past few years, critical theorists and new media scholars like Zeynep Tufekci, Safiya Noble, Shoshana Zuboff and Ruha Benjamin have described the ubiquity of code in political, legal, medical, social, and educational fields, to name a few. They and countless other scholars, artists, and programmers have shown the myriad ways that code, and the systems built on code, can influence everything from our emotional states to the perpetuation of systemic racism. Given the social and cultural power of code, Marino explains, we need to develop methods to account for the way code accrues meaning and how readers and shifting contexts shape that meaning. We need to learn to understand not only the functioning of code but the way code signifies. We need to learn to read code critically (5).

electronic book review (ebr) holds a storied history with Critical Code Studies (CCS). In 2006, ebr published Marino’s proposal for the field of Critical Code Studies. This argument was then presented at the 2007 Modern Language Association meeting, attended by scholars who have played influential roles in software studies, among them Wendy Chun, Alan Liu and Lev Manovich. (For a more thorough overview of this history of the origins of CCS, see Marino pp. 18-23.) The essay, recently republished as the second chapter of Critical Code Studies, challenges humanities scholars to critically evaluate code to understand its significance. Just like a traditional text, code functions as a semiotic and cultural system; code is a medium that reproduces its systems in the ways it signifies. With code, there is an additional need to consider its technical contexts, including the way that hardware and software influence its structure and display.
